  <h2>Standard Privacy Policy for @protocol compliant apps</h2>
  <h4>Updated November 24, 2020</h4>
  <p>
    This application contains private data either created by you or created by others and shared with you. It also may 
    contain data that you or others have chosen to share publicly. 
  </p>
  <p>
    After encryption, this data is transmitted to a cloud server in order to provide backup and synchronization with other devices. It is important to understand that it is provably true that this data cannot be accessed by the operator of the cloud service as the encryption keys remain on the device and are required to decrypt and access the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that all private data belongs to its creator, and can only be accessed by those with permission to view it. Nobody else, including us, can access any of this private data, resulting in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>No surveillance</li>
    <li>No snooping</li>
    <li>No monetization of your data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Remember, the data that you share publicly is public and therefore accessible to anyone, so take care with what you 
    choose to share openly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Welcome to a new way of thinking about data ownership and privacy. Regardless of how you choose to share it, your 
    data should — and will — always belong to you. 
  </p>
  <p>
    How’s that for a privacy policy?
